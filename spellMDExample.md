Meghan created it in Island of Silence and tested it on Ms. Octavia during the private session with Alex, Lani, and Samheed.It is a common battle spell and used in many battles throughout all of the books though used mostly in the original 7 books, and occasionally in the Quests Series. It is also used several times on Quill guards.
