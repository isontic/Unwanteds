### About

Sky is 'the silent girl' who was washed ashore on Artimé on a raft with her brother, Crow in Island of Silence.  She is an orange-eyed teenager from Warbler Island, where Mr. Today is also from. Sky, like Meghan, Lani, Samheed, Crow, and Copper, had the voice-restraining necklace of thorns. When she appeared in Artimé, people were wary at first. While Lani was gone, Alex developed a crush on this mysterious girl and they even shared a kiss.

Sky appears in Island of Silence, Island of Fire, Island of Legends, Island of Shipwrecks, Island of Graves, and Island of Dragons. She also briefly appears in Dragon Captives and Dragon Bones. 

She gets sucked into the Island of Fire volcano, and is stuck in the Land of the Dragons until Thisbe and Rohan find her in the cavelands at the end of Dragon Bones. Sky, along with Thisbe and Rohan, all later discover Alex’s grave. She finally makes it back to Artimé in Dragon Curse, by using the same volcano gateway. In Dragon Slayers, Sky travels to the land of the dragons through the volcano network with the team sent to help the captured Thisbe and Fifer. 

She was depicted on the cover of Island of Shipwrecks.

### Appearance
<img width:”180” alt=“018” src=“https:/i.imger.com/LnSnIQU.png”/> 
Sky has long, wavy, dark copper-colored hair, sunset orange eyes that have a bit of gold (from the acid eye drops that were forced onto all the Warblerans), light brown skin, and plump lips. She has a few scars around her neck from where her Thornament was, and her voice is still hoarse from the damage that was caused by it.  She is exotic-looking and very beautiful. In Island of Dragons, it is guessed by Kaylee that she had South American or Mexican ancestors. In Unwanteds Quests, she obtains freckles, and is also described as having auburn hair with natural highlights. She is inaccurately depicted on the cover of Island of Shipwrecks as her skin is lighter than it is supposed to be, the same as Thisbe and Fifer. 

### Description
Sky is brave, kind, intelligent, and determined. She was scared and shy when she first woke up in Artime, but grows extremely confident as the series goes on. She is considered Alex's main love interest and helps Alex in his struggles. She can easily block out her emotions and focus on the more important factors she is dealing with. She can sometimes appear cold and distant. She follows her head instead of heart, and is constantly thinking things through. She cares deeply for her family, Alex, and eventually all of Artimé too. Sky in Island of Legends managed to cast a tuba spell after her third attempt, and a seek spell in Dragon Ghosts. Sky in general is a natural leader who is not very good with magic, but can definitely use a sword if she needs to. 

## Relationships
### Alex Stowe
Sky and Alex originally were strangers to one another, but they later developed into a romantic relationship by Island of Graves. Sky first met Alex when she woke up in Artimé’s hospital ward after her escape from Warbler. She was quite terrified and even spat water on Alex’s face after he offered it to her, shocking him. However, the two became friends after Artimé lost its magic, and they eventually developed a mutual attraction towards each other. 

Even so, in Island of Legends, the two started acting distant towards one another because Alex thought he couldn’t be in a romantic relationship while being head mage. Sky later would confess her feelings towards Alex in Island of Graves. After this, Sky and Alex decided to become a romantic couple and would end up staying as such until Alex’s death. 

### Fifer Stowe
Sky and Fifer first bonded in Dragon Curse when Sky comforted an upset Fifer during their investigation at Warbler Island. In Dragon Slayers, Sky agrees with Florence’s assumption about Fifer’s note being true, showing that she doesn’t believe Fifer would willingly lie to her allies.
